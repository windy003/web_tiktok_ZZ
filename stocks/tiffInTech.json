The data collection layer fetches posts from financial subreddits, while the ML layer processes text through TextBlob's pre-trained NLP model. This model analyzes linguistic patterns, contextual relationships, and negations to generate sentiment polarity scores ranging from -1 to 1.\n\nData processing is handled through pandas DataFrames, where we aggregate sentiment scores and calculate statistical distributions. The backend uses Flask to serve an API.\n\nWhat sets this apart is its ML-based approach to sentiment analysis. Instead of relying on simple metrics like upvotes, it uses Natural Language Processing to understand the actual content of discussions, providing more nuanced sentiment analysis of market opinions.\n\n#tech #technology #stem #developer #ml #ai"
